Hi and Welcome!, 

My name is Thomas N. Ramirez. I am a senior at Humboldt State University which is located in norhtern california surrounded by redwoods. 
My major is sociology minoring in GeoSpatial Progaming (GSP). I combined these two to help shed light on the social problems that we face in modern times. Sociology will help me translate scientific data to the general mass making them gain awareness of the complexity of current social issues. What I hope to accomplish this semester is a portfolio filled with counter cartography.
