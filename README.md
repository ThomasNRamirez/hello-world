Hi and Welcome!, 

My name is Thomas N. Ramirez. I am a senior at Humboldt State University which is located in Norhtern California.   
My major is sociology minoring in GeoSpatial Progaming (GSP). I combined these two to help shed light on the social problems that we face in modern times. I am interested in gentrification, accessibility to local,state, and federal resources, and understanding the influience of Hispanic's and Latin@'s within the American System and culture. Sociology will help me translate scientific data to the general mass by making them gain awareness of the complexity of current social issues. This will be accomplished through cartography by creating images that are easy to read and understand the depth of the issue being projected. What I hope to accomplish this semester is a portfolio filled with counter cartography.
